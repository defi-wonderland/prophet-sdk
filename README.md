# Prophet SDK

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/defi-wonderland/prophet-sdk/blob/main/LICENSE)

⚠️ The code is under development, tread with caution.

## Overview

Lightweight and user-friendly wrapper around Prophet contracts. The SDK will be a wrapper for blockchain calls, and will support all of the shared interfaces mirroring all of the oracle’s and the modules’ functions in the **[Smart Contracts](https://github.com/defi-wonderland/prophet-core/blob/main/solidity/contracts)**.

The SDK will also support adding custom modules so that any developer can create and use modules specific to their use case.

## Setup

To build it locally, run:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:defi-wonderland/prophet-sdk.git
cd
yarn install
yarn build
```

## Installation

```
